# Feature Specification: Deploy to GitHub Pages

**Feature ID**: `002-deploy-to-gh`
**Created**: 2025-10-06
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "deploy to gh-pages we want to deploy the app to GitHub Pages. The GitHub workflow is going to be triggered only for a tag with the following format pages/vx.y.z where x.y.z is the version number of the app. Once the workflow triggers, it is going to build the production build and then it is going to use the Pages action to deploy the production artifact to GitHub Pages. It is also going to archive the production artifact as the releases. For triggering the workflow, we are going to have a Makefile target."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-06

- Q: When GitHub Pages deployment succeeds but GitHub Release archival fails (or vice versa), what should the system do? ‚Üí A: Do not revert successful deployment; fail workflow for failed step only
- Q: When the production build fails during the GitHub Actions workflow execution, what should happen? ‚Üí A: Workflow fails immediately; developer must fix build and create new tag
- Q: When multiple developers attempt to deploy (create tags) simultaneously or near-simultaneously, what should the system do? ‚Üí A: Git atomicity ensures only one tag succeeds; workflow concurrency control cancels in-progress deployments for same tag
- Q: What level of logging/monitoring should the deployment workflow provide? ‚Üí A: Basic level - Start/completion logs and errors only (minimal output)
- Q: When network failures occur during GitHub API calls or deployment steps, what should the system do? ‚Üí A: Retry automatically 3 times with 500ms wait between attempts

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

As a developer, I want to deploy the Bodhi Chat application to GitHub Pages with a single command, so that the latest version is automatically published and accessible to users without manual deployment steps.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** I have committed and pushed all changes to the repository, **When** I run the deployment command with optional GitHub token, **Then** the system creates a new versioned tag and triggers automatic deployment to GitHub Pages `GH_PAT=gh_pat_xyz make release.pages`
2. **Given** the deployment workflow is triggered by a version tag, **When** the workflow executes, **Then** it builds the production artifacts and publishes them to GitHub Pages
3. **Given** a version tag already exists, **When** I attempt to deploy the same version, **Then** the system asks for confirmation to delete and recreate the tag with default answer as "no"
4. **Given** I have uncommitted or unpushed changes, **When** I run the deployment command, **Then** the system detects this condition and aborts deployment with an informative message
5. **Given** the GitHub API returns an error, **When** fetching releases, **Then** the system provides clear error messages indicating whether the token was used and guidance for resolution
6. **Given** the production build completes successfully, **When** the workflow finishes, **Then** the artifacts are both deployed to GitHub Pages and archived as a GitHub release

### Edge Cases

- **GitHub API Rate Limiting**: When rate limiting is reached without authentication, system provides clear error message indicating lack of token and guidance to provide GH_PAT
- **Network Failures**: System retries network operations automatically (3 attempts with 500ms wait) before failing
- **Build Failures in Workflow**: Workflow fails immediately; developer fixes build locally and creates new tag to retry
- **Simultaneous Deployments**: Git's atomic tag operations ensure only first push succeeds; workflow concurrency control cancels in-progress runs for same workflow
- **Partial Deployment Failures**: If Pages deployment succeeds but release archival fails (or vice versa), system does not revert successful step; workflow fails only for failed step

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST check for uncommitted changes in the git repository before initiating deployment and abort if any exist
- **FR-002**: System MUST check for unpushed commits to the remote repository and abort deployment if local is not synced with remote
- **FR-003**: System MUST accept an optional GitHub Personal Access Token (GH_PAT) for GitHub API operations
- **FR-004**: System MUST fetch existing releases from the repository (bodhiapps/bodhichat) using GitHub API
- **FR-005**: System MUST filter releases by tag pattern "pages/v\*" to identify app deployment releases
- **FR-006**: System MUST sort filtered releases by creation date and select the latest version
- **FR-007**: System MUST automatically bump the selected version by a minor patch to generate the next version number
- **FR-008**: System MUST check if a git tag with the new version already exists locally or remotely
- **FR-009**: System MUST prompt user for confirmation (y/N with default N) to delete and recreate existing tags
- **FR-010**: System MUST abort deployment if user declines to overwrite existing tag
- **FR-011**: System MUST delete both local and remote tags when user confirms overwrite
- **FR-012**: System MUST create a new git tag with format "pages/vx.y.z" after confirmation or if tag doesn't exist
- **FR-013**: System MUST push the newly created tag to the remote repository to trigger deployment
- **FR-014**: Deployment workflow MUST be triggered exclusively by tags matching pattern "pages/v\*"
- **FR-015**: Deployment workflow MUST set package version same as the one in git tag (pages/v[x.y.z], capture the x.y.z version) using npm version command without creating git tag before building
- **FR-016**: Deployment workflow MUST build production artifacts using the standard build process after version is set
- **FR-017**: Deployment workflow MUST deploy production artifacts to GitHub Pages
- **FR-018**: Deployment workflow MUST archive production artifacts as a GitHub release with the same tag
- **FR-019**: Deployment workflow MUST configure concurrency control to prevent simultaneous deployments for the same tag reference
- **FR-020**: Deployment workflow MUST fail immediately if production build step fails without attempting deployment
- **FR-021**: Deployment workflow MUST not revert the deployment if pages step succeeds and releass step, or later step fails
- **FR-022**: Deployment workflow MUST bump patch version suffixed with `-dev` after successful release and commit changes back to repository
- **FR-023**: Deployment workflow MUST log start, completion, and error events only (minimal logging)
- **FR-024**: System MUST retry failed network operations automatically (3 attempts with 500ms wait between retries)
- **FR-025**: System MUST provide clear error messages when GitHub API requests fail, indicating:
  - Whether authentication token was provided
  - The type of error returned (4xx client errors, 5xx server errors)
  - Guidance for resolution (e.g., "Check token validity" or "GitHub token not provided")
- **FR-026**: System MUST handle GitHub API anonymous access limitations and provide appropriate error messages

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001**: Network operations MUST implement retry logic with 3 attempts and 500ms delay between retries
- **NFR-002**: Deployment workflow logging MUST be minimal (start, completion, errors only) to avoid verbose output
- **NFR-003**: Workflow concurrency control MUST prevent race conditions when multiple deployments are triggered simultaneously
- **NFR-004**: Failed deployment steps MUST not revert successful operations (e.g., successful Pages deployment remains even if Release fails)
- **NFR-005**: Post-release version bump and commit MUST be automated to maintain version synchronization

### Key Entities

- **Version Tag**: Git tag following pattern "pages/vx.y.z" where x.y.z represents semantic version number (major.minor.patch)
- **GitHub Release**: Archive of production artifacts associated with a version tag, stored in GitHub releases
- **Production Artifact**: Built application files ready for deployment (HTML, JavaScript, CSS, assets)
- **Deployment Configuration**: Settings including base path, repository information, and GitHub Pages configuration
- **GitHub Personal Access Token**: Optional authentication credential for GitHub API access to avoid rate limiting
