# Feature Specification: GitHub Actions CI/CD Workflow

**Feature ID**: `001-have-github-actions`
**Created**: 2025-10-06
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "have GitHub Actions run the build, the unit test, and the end-to-end test. Finally, publish the coverage report to Codecov. Also have a summary job displaying the summary of the GitHub workflow."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-06

- Q: When should the workflow trigger? → A: push to main
- Q: Which Node.js version should be used? → A: v22+
- Q: Should jobs run in parallel or sequentially? → A: ci.test and e2e in parallel
- Q: How should Codecov token be configured? → A: from environment variable
- Q: Should dependency caching be used? → A: have the npm setup cache dependency, use standard actions for node/npm setup
- Q: How long should artifacts be retained? → A: 3 days of retention for artifacts

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

As a developer working on the Bodhi Chat project, when I push code changes to the main branch, I need an automated validation system that verifies my changes don't break the build, unit tests, or end-to-end tests, while tracking code coverage trends over time and providing a clear summary of validation results.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** code is pushed to the main branch, **When** the automated workflow runs, **Then** the system must execute build verification, unit tests, and end-to-end tests, publish coverage data to Codecov, and display a workflow summary
2. **Given** all validation steps pass successfully, **When** the workflow completes, **Then** developers must be able to see a summary showing all jobs succeeded and coverage was published
3. **Given** any validation step fails (build, unit test, or e2e test), **When** the workflow completes, **Then** the summary must clearly indicate which step failed and the workflow must report failure status
4. **Given** the build passes but tests fail, **When** attempting to publish coverage, **Then** the system must handle this gracefully without blocking the workflow summary
5. **Given** unit tests and e2e tests both execute, **When** they run in parallel, **Then** both must complete independently and the summary must reflect results from both

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the build fails but unit tests try to run? (Tests should not run if build fails)
- What happens when Codecov service is unavailable? (Workflow should continue and report the publishing failure in summary)
- What happens when e2e tests pass but unit tests fail? (Both results should be visible in summary; overall workflow should fail)
- What happens when dependencies cannot be installed? (Workflow should fail early at setup stage)
- What happens when test coverage data is not generated? (Coverage publishing should fail gracefully)
- What happens with concurrent pushes to main? (Each push should trigger independent workflow runs)

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST trigger automated validation when code is pushed to the main branch
- **FR-002**: System MUST verify the project builds successfully by executing the build process
- **FR-003**: System MUST execute unit tests and collect code coverage data
- **FR-004**: System MUST execute end-to-end tests independently of unit tests
- **FR-005**: System MUST run unit tests and end-to-end tests in parallel to minimize total validation time
- **FR-006**: System MUST publish code coverage reports to the Codecov service for coverage tracking
- **FR-007**: System MUST display a consolidated summary showing the status of all validation jobs (build, unit tests, e2e tests, coverage publishing)
- **FR-008**: System MUST use dependency caching to improve workflow execution performance
- **FR-009**: System MUST retain workflow artifacts for 3 days for debugging and analysis purposes
- **FR-010**: System MUST support Node.js version 22 or higher for executing all validation steps
- **FR-011**: System MUST retrieve Codecov authentication credentials from environment variables securely
- **FR-012**: System MUST fail the overall workflow if any critical validation step (build, unit tests, e2e tests) fails
- **FR-013**: System MUST continue to summary reporting even if coverage publishing fails (non-critical failure)

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001**: Workflow execution time SHOULD be minimized through parallel job execution and dependency caching
- **NFR-002**: Workflow status and results MUST be easily visible to developers without requiring deep navigation
- **NFR-003**: Failure messages in the summary MUST clearly indicate which job failed and why
- **NFR-004**: The validation system MUST be reliable enough for developers to trust its results before merging changes
- **NFR-005**: Coverage data publishing MUST integrate seamlessly with Codecov's tracking and trending features

### Key Entities

- **Workflow Run**: Represents a single execution of the CI/CD validation process, triggered by a push to main branch, containing multiple jobs
- **Build Job**: Verification step that compiles TypeScript and creates production-ready artifacts
- **Unit Test Job**: Validation step that executes component tests and generates code coverage data
- **E2E Test Job**: Validation step that executes end-to-end browser tests using Playwright
- **Coverage Report**: Code coverage data artifact generated by unit tests, published to Codecov for tracking
- **Workflow Summary**: Consolidated view showing status and results of all jobs within a workflow run
- **Workflow Artifact**: Any file or data generated during workflow execution (build outputs, test reports, coverage data) retained for 3 days

## Dependencies and Assumptions

### Dependencies

- Codecov service must be accessible for coverage report publishing
- GitHub Actions infrastructure must be available and properly configured
- Project's Makefile commands (build, ci.test, test.e2e) must execute successfully in a CI environment
- Codecov authentication token must be configured as an environment variable in the repository settings

### Assumptions

- Developers have write access to the main branch (or changes come via approved pull requests)
- The project's existing test suite is comprehensive and reliable
- Node.js v22+ runtime environment is compatible with all project dependencies
- Standard npm/node setup actions provide adequate caching mechanisms
- 3-day artifact retention is sufficient for debugging and analysis needs
- Codecov account and project configuration already exist

## Success Criteria

- Developers can see automated validation results within minutes of pushing to main
- All validation steps (build, unit tests, e2e tests) execute reliably on every push
- Code coverage data appears in Codecov dashboard after each successful test run
- Workflow summary clearly communicates pass/fail status for all jobs
- Failed workflows provide enough information for developers to diagnose issues
- Parallel execution of tests reduces total validation time compared to sequential execution
- Dependency caching reduces npm install time on subsequent workflow runs

## Out of Scope

- Pull request validation workflows (only main branch pushes are covered)
- Deployment or publishing of build artifacts to external services
- Manual workflow triggering or scheduled workflow runs
- Integration with other CI/CD platforms beyond GitHub Actions
- Custom test result visualizations beyond Codecov's built-in features
- Performance benchmarking or regression detection
- Security scanning or dependency vulnerability checks
- Notification systems (Slack, email) for workflow results
- Branch protection rules or merge policies
